Appendix 9 Guidance on Emerging Technologies
1.

As the landscape of emerging technology is dynamic and evolving, a
financial institution shall ensure technology risk management framework
(TRMF) is effective in monitoring the build-up of risks at the enterprise level
arising from the use of new technologies. A financial institution shall provide
clarity in its governance arrangement relating to new technologies as follows:
(a) appropriate level of caution, factoring the unintended consequences
such as fairness, ethics, legal liability exposures and frictions to
vulnerable customers in the risk assessment and tolerance level;
(b) acceptance criteria for introduction of new technology and reporting
structure and oversight mechanism to uphold accountability throughout
the lifecycle of adoption;
(c) enhancement of technology and cybersecurity operation controls to
mitigate attendant risks; and
(d) evaluation and improvement of operating control effectiveness on ongoing basis.

2.

A financial institution must only allow the use of emerging technology in a
production environment when, at a minimum, the following requirements are
met:
(a) IT system using the new technology is adequately tested to meet the
service quality, resiliency, and information security objectives of the
institution with residual risk that remains within the financial institution's
risk tolerance level;
(b) availability of industry standards and best practices to effectively test the
operation risk controls and cyber defence. Where this cannot be met,
additional margin of conservatism shall be applied in the risk
assessment and the scope of provision to customers;
(c) the financial institution must be prepared to suspend the use of
emerging technology applications when extreme events such as
adversarial attacks arise;
(d) the financial institution must implement regular monitoring to assess
consistency in the quality of the solution, security and compliance,
enabling timely identification and mitigation to any emerging risks or
issues; and
(e) the financial institution must disclose to users that emerging technology
is utilized in the system, providing adequate information about
associated risks to enable them to make an informed decision before
using the service.

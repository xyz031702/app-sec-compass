A financial institution must ensure that the TRMF is an integral part of the
financial institution's enterprise risk management framework (ERM).

S

9.2

The TRMF must include the following:
(a) clear definition of technology risk;
(b) clear responsibilities assigned for the management of technology risk at
different levels and across functions, with appropriate governance and
reporting arrangements;
(c) the identification of technology risks to which the financial institution is
exposed, including risks from the adoption of new or emerging
technology (refer Appendix 9 on Guidance on Emerging Technologies);
(d) risk classification of all information assets / systems based on its
criticality;
(e) risk measurement and assessment approaches and methodologies;
(f) risk controls and mitigations;
(g) continuous monitoring to timely detect and address any material risks;
(h) effective information system to ensure the technology risk profile
remains accurate and up to date;
(i) identification of key resources and interdependencies (including critical
third party service providers and their connected parties11) which
support delivery of critical technology functions;
(j) undertake scenario analysis to strengthen capacity and readiness to
resume critical systems under severe conditions; and
(k) effective incident management policies and procedures to minimise the
impact of any service disruption on the financial institution and its
customers, by restoring the affected service or system to a secure and
stable state as quickly as possible.

S

9.3

A financial institution must establish an independent enterprise-wide
technology risk management function which is responsible for(a) implementing the TRMF and CRF;
(b) advising on critical technology projects and ensuring critical issues that
may have an impact on the financial institution's risk tolerance are
adequately deliberated or escalated in a timely manner; and
(c) providing independent views to the board and senior management on
third party assessments12, where necessary.

11 Connected parties refers to Nth party as defined by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on

principles for the sound management of third party risk.
12 Relevant third party assessments may include the Data Centre Resilience and Risk Assessment,
Network Resilience and Risk Assessment and independent assurance for introduction of new or
enhanced digital services.

The CISO shall(a) be independent from day-to-day technology operations;
(b) apprise board and senior management of current and emerging
technology risks which could potentially affect the financial institution's
risk profile;
(c) have the requisite technical skills in emerging and core technologies
used by the institution, expertise and experience in audit, governance

TRMF and CRF;
(b) enforcing compliance with these policies, frameworks and other
technology-related regulatory requirements; and
(c) advising senior management on technology risk and security matters,
including developments in the financial institution's technology security
risk profile in relation to its business and operations.

13 In line with the role defined in Responsibility Mapping policy document dated 29 December 2023,

including any amendments or modifications made after the issuance date.
14 A financial institution's CISO may take guidance from the expertise of a group-level CISO, in or outside
of Malaysia, and may also hold other roles and responsibilities provided these do not impair the CISO's
independence or competence. Such designated CISO shall be accountable for and serve as the point
of contact with the Bank on the financial institution's technology-related matters, including managing
entity-specific risks, supporting prompt incident response and reporting to the financial institution's
board.

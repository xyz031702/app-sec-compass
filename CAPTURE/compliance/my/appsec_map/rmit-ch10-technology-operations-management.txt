10.1

A financial institution must establish appropriate governance requirements
commensurate with the risk and complexity15 of technology projects
undertaken. This shall include project oversight roles and responsibilities,
authority and reporting structures, and risk assessments throughout the
project life cycle.

S

10.2

The risk assessments shall identify and address the key risks arising from
the implementation of technology projects. These include the risks that could
threaten successful project implementation and the risks that a project failure
will lead to a broader impact on the financial institution's operational
capabilities. At a minimum, due regard shall be given to the following areas:
(a) the adequacy and competency of resources including those of the
vendor to effectively implement the project. This shall also take into
consideration the number, size and duration of significant technology
projects already undertaken concurrently by the financial institution;
(b) the complexity of systems to be implemented such as the use of
unproven or unfamiliar technology and the corresponding risks of
integrating the new technology into existing systems, managing multiple
vendor-proprietary technologies, large-scale data migration or cleansing
efforts and extensive system customisation;
(c) the adequacy and configuration of security controls throughout the
project life cycle to mitigate cybersecurity breaches or exposure of
confidential data;
(d) the comprehensiveness of the user requirement specifications to
mitigate risks from extensive changes in project scope or deficiencies in
meeting business needs;
(e) the robustness of system and user testing strategies to reduce risks of
undiscovered system faults and functionality errors;
(f) the appropriateness of system deployment and fallback strategies to
mitigate risks from prolonged system stability issues; and
(g) the adequacy of disaster recovery operational readiness following the
implementation of new or enhanced systems.

S

10.3

The board and senior management must receive and review timely reports
on the management of these risks on an ongoing basis throughout the
implementation of significant projects.

15 For example, large-scale integration projects or those involving critical systems must be subject to

more stringent project governance requirements such as more frequent reporting to the board and senior
management, more experienced project managers and sponsors, more frequent milestone reviews and
independent quality assurance at major project approval stages.

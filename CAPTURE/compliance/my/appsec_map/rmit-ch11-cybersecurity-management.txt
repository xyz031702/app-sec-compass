Cyber Risk Management
S

11.1

A financial institution must ensure that there is an enterprise-wide focus on
effective cyber risk management to reflect the collective responsibility of
business and technology lines for managing cyber risks.

S

11.2

A financial institution must develop a CRF which clearly articulates its
governance for managing cyber risks, its cyber resilience objectives and its
risk tolerance, with due regard to the evolving cyber threat environment.
Objectives of the CRF shall include ensuring operational resilience against
extreme but plausible cyber-attacks. The framework must be able to support
the effective identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery
(IPDRR) of systems and data hosted on-premises or by third party service
providers from internal and external cyber-attacks.

S

11.3

The CRF must consist of, at a minimum, the following elements:
(a) development of an institutional understanding of the overall cyber risk
context in relation to the financial institution's business and operations,
its exposure to cyber risks and current cybersecurity posture;
(b) identification, classification and prioritisation of critical systems,
information, assets and interconnectivity (with internal and external
parties) to obtain a complete and accurate view of the financial
institution's information assets, critical systems, interdependencies and
cyber risk profile;
(c) identification
of
cybersecurity
threats,
vulnerabilities
and
countermeasures to secure digital services delivery against cyberattacks and contain reputational damage that can undermine confidence
in the financial institution;
(d) enhancing layers of cyber defence with reference to the latest
international standards and sound practices such as zero-trust
principles33, defense-in-depth through micro-segmentation and security
by design, to protect its data, infrastructure and assets against evolving
cyber threats;
(e) timely detection of cybersecurity incidents through continuous
surveillance and monitoring;
(f) detailed incident handling policies and procedures and a crisis response
management playbook to support the swift recovery from cyber
incidents and contain any damage resulting from a cybersecurity
breach;
(g) policies and procedures for timely and secure information sharing and
collaboration with other financial institutions and participants in financial
market infrastructure to strengthen cyber resilience and fraud
prevention;
(h) implement a centralised automated tracking system to manage its
technology asset inventory; and
(i) establish a cyber risk management function to analyse actual and
potential cyber threats, providing risk assessments and timely

principles is a security paradigm designed to prevent data breaches and limit lateral
movement of threat actors by requiring all users, whether in or outside the organization's network, to be
authenticated, authorised, and validated before being granted the access.

or by leveraging on the parent or group.
S

11.4

A financial institution that is designated as a National Critical Information
Infrastructure (NCII) entity pursuant to the Cyber Security Act 2024 must
ensure compliance to the requirements and guidelines applicable to NCII,
including any additional directives and standards issued by the National
Cyber Security Agency (NACSA).

S

11.5

A financial institution must adopt robust control measures as outlined in
Appendix 5 to enhance its resilience to cyber-attacks.

S

11.6

A financial institution must conduct a realistic "Red Team34" simulation attack
on its infrastructure at least once every three years to proactively identify and
manage potential vulnerabilities.

G

11.7

A financial institution may implement crowdsourced security testing programs
as a complement to existing security assessments, in order to thoroughly test
the security of their IT environment. The financial institution must engage
reputable and credible service providers to facilitate the program.

Cybersecurity Operations
S

11.8

A financial institution must establish clear responsibilities for cybersecurity
operations which shall include implementing appropriate mitigating
measures in the financial institution's conduct of business that correspond to
the following phases of the cyber-attack lifecycle:
(a) reconnaissance;
(b) weaponisation;
(c) delivery;
(d) exploitation;
(e) installation;
(f) command and control; and
(g) exfiltration.

S

11.9

A financial institution must ensure continuous and proactive monitoring and
timely detection of anomalous activities in its technology infrastructure to
prevent potential compromise of its security controls or weakening of its
security posture. This shall include(a) establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) supported by
competent resources and equipped with the necessary tools and
technologies for proactive monitoring of its technology security posture;

34 A red team exercise involves a controlled attempt to rigorously evaluate an institution's security

defences, resilience, and response capabilities. In this exercise, a team of information security experts
known as the "red team" simulates the tactics, techniques, and procedures of potential adversaries to
critically assess the effectiveness of the institution's security measures, with minimal knowledge and
impact on operations.

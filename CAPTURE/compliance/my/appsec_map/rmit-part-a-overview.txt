Introduction

1.1

With the prevalent use of technology in the provision of financial services,
financial institutions must(a) invest in the required expertise and risk controls to prevent operational
disruptions given the complexity of Information Technology (IT) systems;

crimes for public confidence;
(c) maintain robust oversight to prevent transmission of risks with increased
third party interlinkages;

threats amidst heightened cyber risks globally; and

requirements to improve financial institutions' management of technology risk,
including cyber risk. In applying this policy document, a financial institution
shall have regard to the size and complexity of its operations, the level of
technology use and its external stress exposure. Accordingly, larger and more
complex financial institutions, or those with a high degree of digitalisation and
linkages with third parties, are required to adopt more robust risk controls that
commensurate with the increased technology risk exposure of the institution.

1.3

Enforcement or supervisory actions can be taken against the financial
institutions including its directors, officers and employees for any noncompliance with any provision marked as "S" in Part B of this policy document.

1.4

management has material weaknesses which, if not promptly and effectively
addressed, might contribute to, or result in, non-compliance with this policy
document, the Bank may, among others(a) require an independent external review of the overall or specific areas of
the financial institution's technology risk management;
(b) require the financial institution to develop and implement specific

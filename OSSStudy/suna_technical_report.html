    <section id="code-snippets">
        <h2>6. Code Snippets Review</h2>
        
        <h3>Good Example</h3>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <pre><code># From the installation steps in README.md
# Well-structured environment configuration with clear documentation

# Anthropic or OpenAI: 
# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
MODEL_TO_USE="anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"

# OR OpenAI API:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MODEL_TO_USE="gpt-4o"

# Optional but recommended
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key  # Optional
RAPID_API_KEY=</code></pre>
            <p>This configuration approach demonstrates good flexibility by allowing users to choose between different LLM providers while maintaining a consistent interface through the MODEL_TO_USE variable. The clear documentation and organization make deployment more accessible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Concern Example</h3>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <pre><code># From the installation steps in README.md
# Complex deployment requirements with multiple external dependencies

# Configure backend environment:
cd backend
cp .env.example .env  # Create from example if available, or use the following template

# You'll need the following components:
# - A Supabase project for database and authentication
# - Redis database for caching and session management
# - Daytona sandbox for secure agent execution
# - Python 3.11 for the API backend
# - API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI or Anthropic)
# - (Optional but recommended) Tavily API key for enhanced search capabilities</code></pre>
            <p>The deployment process requires multiple external services and dependencies, creating potential friction for adoption and increasing operational complexity. This could be simplified by providing containerized deployment options that bundle these dependencies or offering alternatives for certain components.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitations & Risks</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="risk high">High</span>
                <strong>External Service Dependencies:</strong> Heavy reliance on multiple third-party services (Supabase, Daytona, Redis, LLM providers) creates potential points of failure and operational complexity for self-hosting deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="risk high">High</span>
                <strong>Security Boundaries:</strong> While the sandbox architecture provides isolation, the combination of browser automation with file system access presents significant security risks if container isolation is compromised.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="risk med">Med</span>
                <strong>Resource Intensity:</strong> The Docker-based isolation model provides security but requires substantial computational resources per agent instance, potentially limiting scalability in high-volume deployments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="risk med">Med</span>

            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="risk low">Low</span>
                <strong>Browser Automation Reliability:</strong> Web scraping through Playwright is inherently brittle as target websites change, potentially requiring frequent maintenance to keep automation workflows functioning correctly.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section id="competitive">
        <h2>8. Competitive Context (Optional)</h2>
        <p>Compared to LangChain, Suna offers a more complete end-to-end solution with built-in browser automation and a polished user interface. While LangChain provides a flexible framework for building agent systems, it requires significant custom development to achieve the same level of functionality as Suna's pre-built solution. Suna's browser automation capabilities are more deeply integrated than LangChain's basic web tools, enabling more complex web interactions. However, LangChain offers greater flexibility for customization and has a larger ecosystem of integrations and community extensions.</p>

    <section id="recommendations">
        <h2>9. Recommendations</h2>
        <ul class="recommendations">
            <li><strong>Implement Cost Control Mechanisms:</strong> Develop token usage tracking, budget limits, and optimization strategies to manage LLM API costs, particularly for browser automation tasks that may require multiple LLM calls.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplify Deployment Architecture:</strong> Create containerized deployment options that bundle dependencies (Redis, database) to reduce the complexity of self-hosting and improve adoption rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Local LLM Support:</strong> Integrate with open-source LLMs that can run locally (e.g., Llama, Mistral) to reduce dependency on external API providers and address data privacy concerns.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance Security Documentation:</strong> Develop comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for production deployments, particularly focusing on sandbox isolation and potential attack vectors.</li>

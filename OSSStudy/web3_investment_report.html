        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>The explosive growth of Suna represents a significant inflection point in the evolution of AI agent technology, with profound implications for Web3 investors. The convergence of autonomous AI agents and decentralized blockchain infrastructure creates a unique investment thesis:</p>
            
            <p><strong>As AI agents gain autonomy and capabilities, they will require decentralized infrastructure for computation, data, verification, and economic incentives—precisely the value propositions that Web3 protocols can provide.</strong></p>
            
            <p>This thesis is supported by several key trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The shift from passive AI models to active AI agents capable of autonomous task execution</li>
                <li>Growing concerns about centralization and control of AI infrastructure</li>
                <li>The need for transparent, verifiable AI operations as agents gain more autonomy</li>
                <li>Demand for fair economic models that properly incentivize all participants in AI ecosystems</li>
                <li>The emergence of specialized AI capabilities that can be composed into powerful agent workflows</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Investors positioned at this intersection stand to benefit from both the exponential growth of AI technology and the transformative potential of decentralized systems. The projects and tokens highlighted in this report represent early opportunities to gain exposure to this convergence, though they vary significantly in maturity, risk profile, and alignment with the overall thesis.</p>
            
            <p>As with any emerging technology intersection, a diversified approach focusing on fundamental infrastructure layers is recommended, with particular attention to projects demonstrating genuine utility, active development, and sustainable token economics.</p>

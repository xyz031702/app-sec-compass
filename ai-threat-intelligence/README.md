You are a threat intelligence analyst focused on the AI domain.

I need your executive summary on the AI security landscape from the last two weeks.

Please analyze and summarize the most critical developments, organizing your report into the following sections:

1.  **Key News & Announcements:** What major stories broke?
2.  **Significant Incidents:** What new vulnerabilities, exploits, or model-related incidents were disclosed? (e.g., prompt injections, data poisoning, model theft).
3.  **New Offensive/Defensive Approaches:** Highlight any notable new attack techniques or defensive research papers/strategies.
4.  **New Tooling:** Any new open-source or commercial tools for securing the AI/ML pipeline.
5. keep your research on main news source only like hackernews, dont take those vendor blogs, otherwise you would stuck at browsing too much data
For each section, provide a brief summary of the development and its potential impact. only target ai system or model, not how to leverage ai for existing cybersecurity

Key findings (one‑paragraph summary)
Since 2014 Indonesia has suffered at least nine publicly documented breaches in which the root cause was a router, switch or mobile‑core protocol that could be crashed, hijacked or exposed from the internet. They range from the classic Indosat BGP hijack to mass exploitation of MikroTik Winbox flaws, up to a May 2025 underground sale of Telkomsel’s own SIM‑management control panel. These cases cut across BGP, GTP, Diameter, HTTP/2 SaaS consoles and SOHO router firmware—exactly the attack surface a Defensics‑style fuzz‑testing lab is built to harden.

1  |  Routing‑layer takeovers
Year	Operator / AS	What happened	Protocol flaw	Impact
2014	Indosat (AS4761)	Announced 28,000 bogus BGP routes, hijacking traffic worldwide for 90 minutes. 
ipSpace.net Blog
Inbound route filters missing → malicious or mistaken BGP UPDATE accepted.	Global packet loss and traffic detours; widely cited as the “BGPmon hijack.”
2 Jan 2023	AS138805 (Indonesia)	Leaked several thousand prefixes from Telin (AS7713) to Lintasarta (AS4800). 
Kentik
Route‑leak via EBGP → IBGP confusion.	Short (5‑min) but continent‑wide latency spikes.

Why it matters: Fuzz suites for BGP OPEN/UPDATE parsing and RPKI path validation would flag malformed attributes or reject illegitimate announcements before they hit the global table.

2  |  MikroTik & EdgeRouter device compromises
Year	Campaign	Device / CVE	What attackers gained
2018	Cryptojacking botnet infected >7,500 MikroTik routers across Jakarta and Surabaya via Winbox (CVE‑2018‑14847). 
The Hacker News
Help Net Security
Full router admin → injected Coinhive scripts into every HTTP session → monetised Indonesian traffic.	
2024	Pawn Storm / EdgeRouter botnet – dozens of compromised Ubiquiti EdgeOS routers in Indonesia carried back‑doored SSH daemons and proxied APT phishing kits. 
Trend Micro
Trend Micro
Jan 2025	AIRASHI botnet abuses a zero‑day in Cambium cnPilot routers; infections logged by Indonesian IXPs. 
The Hacker News

Why it matters: These cases hinge on packet‑parser bugs (Winbox), SSH‑banner quirks (EdgeOS) or undisclosed TLV mishandling (cnPilot). Modern fuzz harnesses aimed at router management ports would have popped crash reports long before the exploits went live.

3  |  Mobile‑core & signalling exposures
Date	Operator	What was exposed	Protocol angle
May 2025	Telkomsel	Underground forums advertised access to the “SIM Management Centre” panel (ICCID, IMSI, live suspend/reactivate). 
X (formerly Twitter)
Medium
Panel speaks Diameter / proprietary HTTP / 2 SBI into the HLR/HSS; TLS config and IP‑allow‑list missing.
Oct 2022	All Indonesian MNOs	1.3 billion SIM‑registration rows leaked from the shared real‑name database. 
qrator.net
Bulk extraction via an unsecured KOMINFO API; no mTLS or rate‑limits on the signalling gateway.
Dec 2024	Smartfren	920 k SIM‑activation logs exposed after attackers abused an internal GTP/SBI API. 
Cyber Threat Intelligence

Why it matters: GTP, Diameter and HTTP/2 SBIs are now prime fuzz targets—Defensics has suites for each. A hardened API gateway plus stateful protocol fuzz would likely have blocked or crashed these extraction attempts.

4  |  Infrastructure‑level malware
Campaign	Devices infected in Indonesia	Protocol/vector	Source
VPNFilter (2018–2022)	Thousands of MikroTik/TP‑Link home & small‑office routers in major Indonesian ISPs remained infected years after disclosure. 
Trend Micro
Wikipedia
Multi‑stage firmware exploit chain over HTTP / FTP / Modbus ports.	
Mantis / Meris DDoS botnets (2022‑2023)	Local IXPs saw spikes from MikroTik‑based Meris nodes. 
The Hacker News
Exploited MikroTik Socks4 proxy features via crafted TCP payloads.	

5  |  What these cases tell Telkomsel
Packet‑parser bugs live long – Winbox and EdgeOS flaws from 2018‑2024 still fuel botnets.

Signalling APIs are gold – Telkomsel’s own SIM panel leak shows attackers now hunt live control consoles, not just data dumps.

Routing hygiene counts – Two Indonesia‑origin BGP leaks in a decade underline why every edge router needs RFC 9324 safeguards and live route‑monitor feeds.

6  |  Relevance to Defensics‑style fuzz testing
Protocol suites already exist for BGP, GTP, Diameter, HTTP/2 and MikroTik proprietary services.

A lab that hammers vendor firmware with these suites before field rollout would have lit up crash logs for Winbox, cnPilot, EdgeOS and even malformed Diameter AVPs long before the bad actors arrived.

Pairing that fuzz lab with “test‑and‑attest” runtime agents (quarterly health attestations) closes the gap between lab and live network.

Next steps for a Telkomsel‑NCCS‑style lab
Spin up vendor‑neutral fuzz harnesses (e.g., Synopsys Defensics) alongside open‑source AFL++ for HTTP/2 SBA testing.

Integrate continuous SBOM diffing to catch late firmware changes.

Feed crash reproducers back to vendors under a strict 30‑day patch SLA.






Key message (executive takeaway)
Indonesia’s 5 G roll‑out will decide whether Telkomsel is seen as a global‑class innovator or the next headline breach. Five recent hacks—ranging from a live SIM‑management panel up for sale to BGP hijacks and router takeovers—prove that adversaries are already targeting the device and protocol layer of Indonesian networks. Global leaders now hard‑wire protocol fuzz‑testing, software bills of materials (SBOMs) and zero‑trust attestations into daily operations. By building an in‑house Innovation Test Lab with world‑standard toolkits and a “test‑and‑attest” regime, Telkomsel can leapfrog regional peers and turn security into a board‑level growth story.

1 | Telkomsel’s 5 G moment
Indonesia’s economy is banking on ubiquitous 5 G to power fintech, Industry 4.0 and e‑government. Every new radio unit, container image and API, however, widens the attack surface. Public trust, investor confidence and Jakarta’s digital‑economy targets will hinge on how confidently Telkomsel hardens that surface.

Lesson: Packet‑parser bugs and unsecured management planes—not web‑app passwords—spark the biggest telecom crises.

3 | Global practice we can leverage
NSA/CISA “Enduring Security Framework” publishes step‑by‑step 5 G cloud‑hardening guides—free blueprints Telkomsel can adopt. 
CISA

NIST SP 1800‑33 (2025) offers a reference 5 G core build mapped to risk and ROI, ideal for board‑level dashboards. 
NIST Computer Security Resource Center

EU 5 G Toolbox + NIS2 combine vendor‑risk scoring, strict access control and 24‑hour breach reporting—showing how regulators are baking live assurance into licences. 
Digital Strategy
EUR-

These programmes turn security from a one‑off test into a living metric that C‑suites track.

4 | Telkomsel’s current footing
ISO 27001 certified network ops and a national SOC give a solid base.

Ongoing migration to cloud‑native 5 G SA core and early Open RAN pilots.

Participation in government‑backed “Gerakan 100 Smart City” elevates public‑sector scrutiny.

Gap: no unified protocol‑fuzz or SBOM regime; certification stops once gear leaves the staging rack.

5 | Five collaborative moves for FY 2026
Move	Outcome
Launch Telkomsel Innovation Test Lab with Synopsys Defensics suites for BGP, GTP, Diameter, HTTP/2 and O‑RAN, plus open‑source AFL++—pulling state‑of‑the‑art fuzz research straight into device acceptance.	Finds parser crashes before deploy; attracts vendor co‑funding.
Publish phase‑two security profiles for radio units, slice managers and analytics nodes.	Closes fresh attack paths as 5 G SA and network‑slicing scale.
Adopt “test & attest.” Quarterly protocol‑health attestations and live SBOM diffing reported to the CTO Office.	Turns security into a board metric; flags config drift early.
Issue a Telkomsel Zero‑Trust Blueprint aligned with NSA/NIST playbooks but tuned to KOMINFO lawful‑access rules.	Gives every BU a single target; eases roaming/security negotiations.
Run Open RAN security plug‑fests with local universities and device makers.	Builds Indonesian expertise; keeps vendor costs competitive; PR win.

6 | Strategic outcomes for Telkomsel
Outage minutes avoided: protocol crashes caught in the lab, not in production—saving millions in SLA penalties.

Faster breach containment: SBOM‑driven patching slashes vulnerability‑to‑fix time.

Market leadership: “Telkomsel Assured” badge raises customer trust and opens export‑gear revenue.

RegTech alignment: readiness for any future KOMINFO security mandates, ahead of rivals.

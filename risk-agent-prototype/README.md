## Risk Agent Prototype — Product Overview

**Version:** 1.1 • April 2025

---

### 1. Problem Statement
Organizations face four primary challenges when translating cybersecurity research into action:

- **Slow, Manual Research:** Analysts spend days consolidating threat intelligence, tool capabilities, and best practices from disparate sources.
- **Fragmented Toolchains:** Security scanners (SAST, SCA, model‑scan, threat feeds) operate in isolation, requiring custom scripts to integrate.
- **Lack of Measurable Outcomes:** Teams struggle to demonstrate quantifiable risk reduction or compliance alignment to stakeholders.
- **Compliance & Audit Gaps:** Regulatory frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST SSDF) demand traceable artefacts, yet tool outputs aren’t structured for audit purposes.

---

### 2. Product Overview
**Risk Agent Prototype** is an AI‑powered platform that automates the end‑to‑end security lifecycle in four stages:

1. **Deep Research**  
   - Multi‑model LLMs combined with academic partnerships curate a security knowledge graph, reusable tool servers, benchmark datasets, and adversarial test models.

2. **Profile Selection**  
   - Users pick a pre‑configured risk profile (e.g., SBOM audit, AI‑model scan, cloud misconfiguration) to instantiate a tailored toolchain and dataset library.

3. **Automated Orchestration**  
   - A hierarchical task planner and policy learner transform objectives into deterministic workflows, invoking the right scanners and enforcing pre/post‑conditions.

4. **Publish and Analysis**
   - Once the implementatin is done, we can publish the workflow as a MCP App. 
   - We can re-use existing MCP App to run repeatable analysis over different targets.

5. **Evaluation & Reporting**  
   - Built‑in benchmarking harness executes curated datasets, measures accuracy and performance, and generates compliance‑ready reports with versioned artefacts.

### 3. Core Components

| Component                     | Description                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge Graph**           | Continuously updated graph of CVEs, CWE mappings, exploit chains, SBOM deltas, and compliance controls.         |
| **Planner Engine**            | HTN‑style planner that sequences security tasks based on research and policy rules.                              |
| **Orchestration Layer**       | RL‑driven policy learner that optimises tool selection and execution order for cost‑effective risk reduction.    |
| **Tool Server Microservices** | Containerised SAST, SCA, model‑malware classifiers, and threat‑feed services ready to deploy on‑demand.           |
| **Benchmark Engine**          | Automated harness with curated datasets for end‑to‑end validation, accuracy metrics, and regression tracking.    |
| **Adversarial Generator**     | Domain‑tuned LLM that produces counter‑cases and malformed payloads to stress‑test workflows and uncover weaknesses. |

### 4. Unique Value Proposition
- **True End‑to‑End Automation:** Collapses research, planning, execution, and evaluation into a single platform.
- **Audit‑Ready Artifacts:** Versioned Markdown/JSON and OSCAL exports ensure regulatory compliance and repeatable audits.
- **Domain‑Tuned Intelligence:** Proprietary knowledge graph and adversarial LLM deliver real‑world accuracy and resilience.
- **Adaptive Optimization:** Policy learning reduces cloud costs and maximises scanner coverage over time.
- **Plug‑and‑Play Profiles:** Out‑of‑the‑box risk templates accelerate onboarding and minimize customization overhead.

### 5. Competitive Differentiators
- **Cursor:** Provides in‑IDE code suggestions only; Risk Agent automates the entire security lifecycle from research through bench­marking.
- **Manus:** Offers research assistance but lacks structured provenance and automation; Risk Agent version‑controls insights and operationalizes them in pipelines.
- **Auto‑GPT:** Enables autonomous scripting but generates no audit‑ready artefacts; Risk Agent delivers compliance‑grade reports and traceable workflows.
- **Devin:** Focuses on code generation without integrated research or compliance layers; Risk Agent embeds audit artefacts and security policy enforcement.
- **Dify:** Supports generic low‑code workflow design but lacks domain‑specific datasets or evaluation harness; Risk Agent includes built‑in benchmarking and adversarial testing.

User:
If I share this link—https://huggingface.co/tensorblock/nanollama-GGUF/tree/main—could you outline an itemized AI testing plan ranked by feasibility?


AI:

(Reasoning...)

Since you only have access to the raw model artifacts (no training code, data pipelines, or runtime environment), we must start with purely offline, file-based checks and progressively move toward execution-based and adversarial tests. The feasibility ranking reflects the minimal setup required at each stage:

Model Metadata & Integrity Check
– Reasoning: With only the files at hand, verifying presence and checksum correctness is trivial.
– What: Confirm all GGUF artifacts exist and match expected hashes or manifest entries.
– Tools: sha256sum, manifest diff scripts.
– Feasibility: High

Container Schema & Compliance Validation
– Reasoning: Parsing the GGUF format requires no execution of model weights—just a compliant parser.
– What: Inspect headers, tags, quantization metadata.
– Tools: modelscan or any GGUF-aware binary inspector.
– Feasibility: High

Model Malicious-Code Scan
– Reasoning: Static analysis can flag embedded payloads without needing to run the model.
– What: Scan binaries for hidden executables, scripts, or suspicious byte patterns.
– Tools: YARA with custom rules, antivirus engines, modelscan --malicious.
– Feasibility: Medium–High

Loading & Tokenizer Initialization Test
– Reasoning: A minimal runtime environment is required to load weights and tokenizer, but no heavy inference yet.
– What: Write a small script to import the GGUF file, initialize the tokenizer, and tokenize a simple prompt.
– Tools: Python GGUF loader, Hugging Face tokenizers.
– Feasibility: Medium

Inference Consistency & Determinism Test
– Reasoning: Once you can load the model, verifying reproducible outputs needs only light inference and seed control.
– What: Run a fixed prompt (e.g., “1+1=”) under a fixed RNG seed and compare outputs.
– Tools: Framework RNG seed APIs, simple output diff.
– Feasibility: Medium

Performance Benchmarking & Resource Profiling
– Reasoning: Requires a full runtime environment and representative hardware, but still relatively straightforward.
– What: Measure tokens/sec, latency, and memory footprint.
– Tools: LM Evaluation Harness or custom timers and profilers.
– Feasibility: Medium–Low

Training-Data Documentation & Quality Check
– Reasoning: Without direct access to the original dataset, you rely on the model card and metadata disclosures.
– What: Review stated data sources, licensing, known biases, and gaps.
– Tools: Manual audit of README/model card; metadata extractors.
– Feasibility: Low

Functional Capability Assessment
– Reasoning: Validating task-specific performance entails creating or obtaining evaluation prompts and scoring mechanisms.
– What: Test on question answering, summarization, etc., using a small labeled set.
– Tools: Curated prompt–response pairs; BLEU/ROUGE or human review.
– Feasibility: Low

Adversarial Prompt Vulnerability Assessment
– Reasoning: Requires iterative testing to craft effective jailbreaks or injection patterns against the loaded model.
– What: Run known adversarial prompts to elicit unintended behavior or policy breaches.
– Tools: Adversarial-prompt libraries, custom harness.
– Feasibility: Low

End-to-End Red-Teaming & Security Stress Test
– Reasoning: The most involved stage—needs a robust harness, fuzzers, compute resources, and monitoring to uncover deeper vulnerabilities.
– What: Feed randomized or malformed binary and text inputs, monitor for crashes, hangs, or resource exhaustion.
– Tools: Fuzzers (e.g. AFL), stress-test frameworks, system monitors.
– Feasibility: Very Low

Maybe perform the Model SCA

AI:

(Reasoning:  “When you say ‘Model SCA,’ I map that directly to our Model Metadata & Integrity Check. You’re asking to statically analyze the GGUF artifacts—verify presence, file names and sizes, and checksums—before any runtime or inference steps.”)
I’d interpret that as running the Model Metadata & Integrity Check step. In other words, you’d:

Verify that all GGUF artifacts are present and uncorrupted

Check file sizes and names against the manifest

Validate checksums (e.g. SHA-256) to ensure no tampering or corruption
(Tool Calling tools/model-sca/analyze-models.sh)

[Output]
Model Integrity Checker

This script verifies the integrity of a downloaded model by comparing it with the original model
from Hugging Face. Instead of downloading the entire model again, it uses a combination of:
1. Metadata comparison
2. Strategic sampling of model chunks
3. Checksum verification of critical components

[End Output]

Please refer to the output for the results of the integrity check in hf-sca-output/model-meta/result_sample.html

Would you want me to perform Model Malicious-Code Scan?

User:
Yes, ok, go ahead

AI:

(Reasoning:  When talk about malicious code, I may check 'ToolServer Index' to see which tool to use, we should use modelscan)

Please refer to the output for the results of the malicious code scan in ui/ui_analysis_results.html

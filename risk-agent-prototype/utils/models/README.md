# Models for Generating Countercases

This directory is reserved for models that can generate countercases for evaluation of the AI Model Security Analysis Framework. While currently empty, this directory will eventually contain models or model definitions that can be used to create test cases with specific security properties.

## Purpose

The models in this directory serve several key purposes:

1. **Automated Test Case Generation**: Generate a diverse set of test cases with varying security properties
2. **Adversarial Example Creation**: Create challenging edge cases to test the robustness of security analysis tools
3. **Counterfactual Generation**: Produce variants of models with specific security properties modified
4. **Benchmark Creation**: Generate standardized benchmark datasets for consistent evaluation

## Planned Model Types

### 1. Vulnerability Generators

Models that can automatically inject specific vulnerabilities into clean models:
- Pickle vulnerability injector
- Backdoor injector
- Network exfiltration code injector
- Prompt injection vulnerability creator

### 2. Adversarial Model Generators

Models that create adversarial examples designed to evade detection:
- Obfuscated malicious code generator
- Steganographic payload injector
- Detection evasion optimizer

### 3. Synthetic Dataset Generators

Models that generate synthetic datasets with controlled security properties:
- Balanced vulnerability dataset creator
- Progressive difficulty benchmark generator
- Edge case synthesizer

## Implementation Plan

The implementation of these models will follow a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic vulnerability injection models for common attack vectors
2. **Phase 2**: More sophisticated adversarial model generators
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced synthetic dataset generators with controllable properties

## Usage Guidelines

Once implemented, models in this directory will follow a standardized interface:

```python
# Example usage pattern
from models.vulnerability_generator import PickleVulnerabilityInjector

# Load a clean model
clean_model_path = "dataset/clean/nanollama-clean.gguf"

# Create a vulnerability injector
injector = PickleVulnerabilityInjector(
    vulnerability_type="code_execution",
    evasion_level="medium"
)

# Generate a vulnerable model
vulnerable_model_path = "dataset/malicious/generated/pickle_vulnerable_1.gguf"
injector.inject(clean_model_path, vulnerable_model_path)
```

## Model Selection Guidelines

When implementing models for this directory, they should be:

1. **Realistic**: Generate vulnerabilities that resemble real-world threats
2. **Controllable**: Allow fine-grained control over the properties of generated test cases
3. **Reproducible**: Produce consistent results for benchmarking
4. **Documented**: Include clear documentation on capabilities and limitations
5. **Ethical**: Include appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse

## Note on Responsible Use

The models in this directory are intended solely for security research and evaluation purposes. They should only be used in controlled environments with appropriate safeguards. Any generated malicious models should be handled with care and not distributed outside of the evaluation environment.
